      <p>
        This Korean fried chicken recipe is officially my favorite. I've had
        every style of fried chicken known to man, so I've always considered
        myself an expert. No other method I've come across has the same
        combination of tender, juicy, flavorful chicken and plate-scratching
        crispiness as this recipe does. It's simply a must-try!

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li class="section-label">Marinade</li>
        <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, quartered</li>
        <li>½ yellow onion, grated</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li class="section-label">Other</li>
        <li>4 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li class="section-label">Batter</li>
        <li>¾ cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>½ cup self-rising flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup very cold water, or as needed</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>
          <i>Make marinade:</i><br />Stir together chicken, onion, garlic, salt,
          and pepper in a medium bowl until chicken is coated. Cover the bowl
          with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 4 hours to overnight.
        </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 340 °F (171 °C).</li>
        <li>
          <i>While oil is heating, make the batter:</i><br />Whisk cornstarch,
          flour, sugar, pepper, and salt together in a large bowl. Gradually
          whisk in cold water until mixture resembles a smooth batter. Use tongs
          to remove chicken from marinade to batter; stir to coat chicken
          completely. Discard marinade.
        </li>
        <li>
          Working in batches, fry chicken in hot oil for 4 minutes. Transfer
          chicken to a cooling rack.
        </li>
        <li>Increase oil temperature to 375 °F (190 °C).</li>
        <li>
          Working in batches, fry chicken again in hot oil until golden brown
          and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to drain.
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
